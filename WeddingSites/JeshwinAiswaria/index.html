                                    A trip to Philly around 2011 was the first time I met Aiswaria (Nimmi as I like to call her). What was supposed to be a casual encounter between our moms who haven’t seen each other since college in approximately 30 years led to me meeting Nimmi. Aim chats became texts, texts became phone calls that lasted till 3:00 AM, which then upscaled to oovoo video calls, and our friendship grew. Once we both started college, we began our solo journeys without much contact until 2017. I decided to message Nimmi by congratulating her after seeing a dance video on Facebook that had quite a number of views. We started casually talking/checking up on each other until I decided to open up to her at St. Raymond Catholic Church in Bronx, NY. We started doing study dates together and I would fly down and visit her. We would cook together and do just about any couple things you can think of.  Slowly I realized I was falling in love with Nimmi. After a couple of years around 2019, our presence in each other’s lives was such an essential factor that it did not feel right without calling and telling her good night or getting up to that good morning text/facetime. Fast forward to 2020, I asked Nimmi to marry me, and I cannot wait to see my baby boo at the altar!

                                        The story really begins in 2011 when my mom's friends from R.A.K. Delhi nursing school came over. That's where I met Jeshwin for the first time! I remember our families planning a trip to New York and Jeshwin betting with my mom that he would eat all her spicy meen (fish) curry if she let my sisters and I go to New York with his family. To everyone's surprise, he ended up winning the bet! Soon after, he and his family went back to Texas, but we still kept in touch. This was before unlimited talk, text, and Facetime. We had to find creative ways, like oovoo, to spend time with each other, and we would stay up all night talking. Once we started college, we lost touch. Years later, he messaged me about a dance video he really liked of mine. He made an impromptu visit to NY. After that, he continued to visit me while I was finishing up with PA school. When he would visit, he would make my favorites, chicken tikka, and biryani, while I studied for my exams. Even when we were miles apart, he made it clear how much he loved and cared for me. Whether that was by sending surprise flowers or staying up all night on Facetime while I studied, he always found a way. It was his genuine love for his family, his devotion to God, and his go-getter personality that made me realize that he is the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Fast forward to the beginning of 2020, he surprised me with a beautiful proposal and asked me to be his wife. Jeshwin, I am so excited to spend the rest of my life with you. Counting down the days till our forever :)

                        <p><b>*Maid of Honor*</b> <br>23 years ago, my parents brought home a special gift for my Chechi. Wrapped in a pink blanket, there I was with my incredibly 
                            adorable face, fresh from the hospital. Ever since then, I think she can agree that day has changed her life for the better. All jokes aside, I cannot 
                            imagine how life would’ve been like without Surya Chechi. She is a genuine and kind-hearted person who always puts her family and friends first. 
                            If you need help, she is the type of person who will drop everything, no matter what, and come to the rescue. She always wants the best for the people 
                            she loves. She does not give up until she has accomplished what she has set out to do. Being the firstborn daughter of an immigrant family, chechi has 
                            assumed many responsibilities. She has been the voice of reason, an amazing role model, and my best friend. I am beyond excited to be standing beside my 
                            Surya chechi and Jeshwin chettai as they begin the journey to married life. They are both such wonderful people who deserve each other’s love. I wish 
                            chechi and chettai an incredibly joyous, blessed, and long life together!

                        <p><b>*Sister of Jeshwin*</b> <br>Jeshwin and I are a year and a half apart which means we fought a lot when we were younger and got closer as we got older. 
                            We fought, we cried, we laughed, we patched up, got in trouble, lied for each other, and covered for each other. I have too 
                            many memories with him and I can’t really pick out one that really stands out because all the memories are special and precious. 
                            We pretty much did everything together.  Jeshwin is much more social and loves making friends and relationships that last. He 
                            treats people with respect and kindness. He values relationships and I am very excited for this new chapter in his life and the 
                            new sister-in-law.

                        <p>Surya has always been my little sister. I have watched her grow up into the person she is today, and that to me has been a privilege. She has grown into a beautiful, 
                            kind-hearted, generous, and genuine soul. Not only has she become my sister, but one of my closest friends. I know I can count on her for anything. When people ask 
                            me how we know each other, I say she is family because that is exactly who she is to me. Surya is someone I go to when things get hard or when there is so much going 
                            on in life, even though we are years apart. She has always been an ear to listen or a shoulder to lean on. She is always someone in my life to cheer me on and genuinely 
                            is proud and excited when something great happens in my life. I am so happy to see this next milestone in her life and to stand by her as she starts a new journey with Jeshwin. 
                            I am incredibly proud of who she is and the heart she has. It’s very rare to find people in this world like her, and I consider myself very blessed to have Surya in my life.

                        <p>Aiswaria and I met my freshman year at Stony Brook University through Taandava, the classical Indian dance team on campus. That is where our friendship began. As a freshman 
                            overwhelmed in a new environment, Aiswaria was the “older sister,” I looked up to. She was quick to offer advice and helped me settle into college as a home away from home. 
                            She is always determined to make those around her feel comfortable as well as challenge them to be the best version of themselves. It is her genuine and caring personality 
                            and her down to earth persona that makes Aiswaria the perfect friend. Genuine people are so rare to find, and I am so blessed to have found that in her. I am so grateful that 
                            after graduating from Stony Brook, we were able to maintain and deepen our friendship. I look forward to being a part of all the memories that are to come in her life, and I 
                            am so excited to stand by Aiswaria on this important day! Congratulations to the beautiful couple!!

                        <p>I am a childhood friend of the groom’s and instantly became friends with Aiswaria when we were introduced. Jeshwin is the cheesiest, silliest, and one of the most respectful
                             guys I have ever met. I still remember the day I met him about 15 years ago. I walked into my 7th grade CCD class and there he was. His hair was buzzed VERY short and he 
                             sat away from everyone. My other friend immediately went up to him and asked who he was. He seemed nervous but cool. After that we all became friends. We talked every week
                             or so and eventually during high school I moved down the street from him and started attending the same school. Even though we went to different universities, we still kept 
                             in touch and hung out whenever the other was in town. It sort of became like a tradition. If we were both in the same town, we made it a point to at least see each other once 
                             and catch up like old times. When Jeshwin told me about Aiswaria, I was so happy for him. She seemed like an amazing person. When I finally met Aiswaria, I instantly noticed 
                             similar traits that I saw in Jeshwin. Not only is she silly and respectful, she’s also humble, hardworking, caring, funny, and most of all makes Jeshwin a better person than 
                             he already is. They are amazing together and I am so glad they found each other. They definitely bring the best out of each other. I wish them nothing but happiness and a 
                             blessed married life.

                        <p>I met Surya while I was working at a doctor's office. She was there as an intern after graduating from Stony Brook University. She was different from other girls that I have met. 
                            Surya is a classy woman;  she does not compromise her values easily. She is such a hardworking person and someone you can count on. She is someone that I can ask and share anything 
                            with. She is empathetic, kind, and truly a rare gem. She is my soul sister and my best friend!! Surya, I would like to say I love you so much and thank you for being a true friend. 
                            I am honored to have her in my life. I am so excited that she has found her perfect match and I pray that God blesses them both. I am eagerly waiting for their big day to come. </p>

                        <p>Where to begin? It all started in December of 2002 when my family went caroling with our church ward one night. I saw Surya sitting on the couch and decided to talk to her, and the rest is history. 
                            We didn't know it at the time, but that, my friends, was the beginning of our lifelong friendship and 18-year journey to this day. I didn't know that that night I would meet my best friend, but 
                            God works in mysterious ways, doesn't He? Through all the dance practices, church events, hangouts at our houses, city adventures, meals together, and all that life's thrown at us, I couldn't have 
                            asked for a better friend to grow through the years with. She's been at my side through thick and thin. She's played a part in helping me become the person I am today. She embodies a depth of loyalty 
                            I wish to emulate, and just as her name suggests, she brings light into our lives. No matter how many miles apart we are, know that I've always got your back, and I am cheering you on. I am so happy 
                            that you found your other half and best friend that you can share your life and take on the world with. I wish you both nothing but love and blessings in this next chapter of your lives together. 
                            Congratulations to this perfect couple, and wishing you many blessings ahead!

                        <p>Aiswaria and I met freshman year of college, where we happened to be in the same chem lab. On our first day, she randomly came up to me and started a conversation. I quickly realized that she was different 
                            and had this gut feeling that we would be good friends. Our friendship grew, and I realized that she wasn’t afraid to be vulnerable and speak her mind. She is kind and so much fun to be around. We didn't 
                            have many classes together, but we always made time for each other. I never doubted our friendship for a second as she was someone I knew that I could always count on. After college, she moved back to Philly, 
                            and we both became immersed in our journey to grad school. A year later, as fate would have it, we discovered that we lived only a few blocks away from each other in the Bronx. Throughout our seven years of 
                            friendship, I have seen how caring, honest, and fun she is. I am so grateful that we’re friends. Words cannot explain how excited I am to know that she will be marrying the love of her life. Jeshwin and Aiswaria’s 
                            love is apparent to anyone who spends a single moment with them. Congratulations to you both; you deserve a world of happiness!  I’m so honored to be a part of your special day and see you start the next chapter 
                            of your lives together.

                        <p>Surya and I met as classmates in CCD during the 7th grade. Since then, she has proven to be one of the most intelligent, strong-willed, and compassionate women I know. She has always been a source of stability for me. 
                            Despite the stress of exams, assignments, and work, Surya has been there to help take my mind off things and enjoy life. Although she was stressed and busy herself, she would always find a way to make time for me. To 
                            have her friendship means that you are loved and cared for and that you will always have someone to support you even when you are at your lowest. I am so happy that I can now be there to support her on one of the most 
                            important days of her life! I wish many years of love and happiness to the beautiful couple. Congratulations! </p>

                        <p>My friendship with Aiswaria can be described as an amalgamation of asynchronously shared experiences. We met at Stony Brook back in 2012. Our paths crossed again in Mercy College, where we went to PA school. We may 
                            not see each other often, but if you know Aiswaria, you know that to her, time and distance are never a hindrance to maintaining a quality relationship. If she considers you a friend, rest assured she will always be 
                            praying for your best and invested in your happiness. I'm honored to stand beside her and cannot wait to celebrate this next beautiful chapter in her life! Here's to 2021 and happily ever after!

                        <p>
                            I’ve known Jeshwin ever since high school, 10th grade to be exact. I would describe Jeshwin as a friend who always has your back. Though life took 
                            us towards different careers and cities, we stayed in touch. Jeshwin is family to me and I’m glad his life partner selection is better than his shot 
                            selection 😘. I am excited to be a part of and celebrate with you and Aiswaria on y’all’s big day!

                        <p>Jeshwin is THAT guy your parents want you to be like. Growing up, he was always on top of what needed to be done, and much better. Though he has been 
                            the benchmark to live up to, I also see him as someone I can be genuine with. We have shared dreams, pizza and plenty of time with GTA. Cheers to 
                            Aiswaria for snagging up a good one!

                        <p>I met Jeshwin over 10 years ago when I first came to the US. It was not until 2017 that I really got to know him, when he got hired at the same company 
                            I was working for in Kansas City. The only true malayalees we knew there were each other. Some of the best years I have spent were with Jeshwin. 
                            He is always the responsible person in the group. I am so glad I have a friend that I can call my brother. Congratulations to the happy couple!

                        <p>As the new kid on the CCE block, Jeshwin was the quiet and pavam (innocent) guy in our friend group. Eventually, Jeshwin became one of my best friends. 
                            When we were in high school, I could always rely on him to guide me through chemistry. He is the type of person who you can always count on. Knowing 
                            Jeshwin as long as I have, I am certain that he is the perfect match for Aiswaria. Congratulations to you both!

                        <p>Jeshwin and I met back in Elkins high school and since then, I always knew we were going to be great friends. Growing up together, we have always been 
                            part of each other’s lives. He’s been like a brother to me and someone I can always count on. We have worked on cars together, played ball, and have 
                            been on many tremendous adventures. There is a never dull moment with you my man and I’m thrilled to be by your side on your big day! I wish you and 
                            Aiswaria all the best.

                        <p>I've known Jeshwin since highschool. We had classes together and I always remember him working hard while I goofed around in class. We grew up playing 
                            basketball and we would  always call him Kobe. Not because he made all the shots, but because he never passed the ball. More recently, we played together 
                            after a long time and it's nice to see that nothing has changed. One thing I love about Jeshwin is that he always gives his 100%. Whether it be in school, 
                            with basketball or just about everything. I consider him as my family and my brother who I can always count on. Congratulations to Jeshwin and Aiswaria and 
                            this new journey.

                        <h4>Melwin Thomas</h4>
                        <p>Jeshwin and I became friends back in high school when we used to play basketball in our neighborhood. Living on the same street, we have spent a lot of time 
                            with each other. We found our relationship evolving into a lifelong friendship. We have created a lot of memories with each other, filled with lots of laughter 
                            and other shenanigans that can not be mentioned here. I am proud of Jeshwin for finding the girl of his dreams and for starting this next chapter in his life.

                        <h4>Siby Baby</h4>
                        <p>Jeshwin and I grew up together. We have spent a lot of time together on various adventures and he has always been a great friend to me. One of his most admirable 
                            qualities is his desire to take on responsibilities and fulfill them in a conscientious manner. Plus, he’s a great cook. I am proud of him for starting this next 
                            chapter of his life and I wish him and Aiswaria the best life has to offer.
