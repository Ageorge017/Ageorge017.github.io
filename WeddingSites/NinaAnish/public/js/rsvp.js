She is incredibly sweet, authentic, honest, loyal, funny, and caring. That is why I am so excited that she is marrying Anish. I think they are incredibly compatible and quite simply, made for each other.

But honestly, Anish was the one with all the answers, and I was the one with all the problems. I have never seen him upset or sad or question anything. I would often tell people about Anish (including  his Super Star Resume) and how he inspired me to reach great heights as well. In an Industry that is cutthroat, Anish always lifted up my spirits, even when I worked as a Deli clerk applying for my first corporate Job. His cheerful and warm outlook has greatly influenced so much of my optimism for my own life. Nina came into our life much later on. I remember the first time I talked to her was in the car with Anish and I was super excited because I knew they would love Christine (my boo ). In the time that I have gotten to know Nina, I see how Nina‚Äôs strengths perfectly align with Anish‚Äôs values: having the ability to make everyone feel warm and at home, cherishing her relationships with the entirety of her heart, and the relationship she has with Christine (I‚Äôm low key jealous of their cuddle time). 10 years from being schooled by Anish on the wrestling floor, I am proud of the man he‚Äôs become, and beyond honored to stand with him on his wedding day, and for the rest of his life.</p>`
