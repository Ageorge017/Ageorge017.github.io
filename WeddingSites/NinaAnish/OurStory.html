                            <p>Our story starts off the summer before I started high school. I was randomly browsing through Facebook one day and a cute Indian guy from New Rochelle High School caught my eye. When I came across his page, I told my cousin Jenny to check him out. She not only checked him out, but went ahead and clicked the friend request button. I was mortified! One day later, I received a notification: ‚Äú Anish Chacko wrote on your wall‚Äù </p>
                            
                            <p>HeYyYyY</p>

                            <h3>...became two friends.</h3>
                            <p>This may seem unattractive to you but back then I was ecstatic. We got to know each other more after that post and Anish quickly became one of my best friends.  After school he would carry my backpack to the bus stop where we would just talk until our buses came. Then when we went home we would call each other and be on the phone till 3 am almost every day! We were pretty much inseparable and my crush only grew from there. (I never told him this of course, because I was too shy). One year later and it was time for Anish to graduate and move on to college. We always kept in touch and would call each other from time to time but eventually we both went our separate ways and it seemed like we would just be casual friends from that point on. </p>

                            <h3>And that turned...</h3>
                            <p>Little did I know, I wasn‚Äôt done with this guy at all !  During winter break of my junior year at Albany, I came home and went to my local gym. After finishing my workout I saw a very familiar face from the corner of my eye. I quickly realized it was Anish and panicked! The last thing I wanted was for Anish to see me all sweaty and gross.   Anish also saw me and he came over to me with this huge smile on his face. We started chatting and realized we had so much to catch up on, so he asked if he could call me that night. I was so nervous but excited. I didn't think he would actually call, but a couple of hours later I found myself catching up and laughing on the phone with him just like we did in highschool . But once again, one of us had to go back to college (this time it was me) and we drifted apart. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>A year later, I had graduated from Suny Albany and was back home in New Rochelle. Anish happened to put a really cute picture of his niece Kezia on his Snapchat Story, and I had to respond because she was so adorable!</p>

                            <h3>...into something indescribable.</h3>
                            <p>This moment sparked a conversation that led to multiple late night conversations, talking about anything and everything. We were both starting to  catch feelings for each other but didn't want to admit it out of fear that it would ruin our friendship. Until one day, I noticed Anish was being distant and I could tell he had something on his mind. I had never felt him being so shy around me, he kept beating around the bush so I finally asked him what was up.  He finally confessed and said  ‚ÄúI am really attracted to you , I don't think I've ever cared for a girl the way I care about you.  but I can‚Äôt tell if you feel the same way‚Äù. My 14 year old dreams finally came true, and words couldn‚Äôt express how happy I was. I could finally stop being shy and finally tell my high school crush and my best friend how I really felt about him all these years. That old spark kept going and finally 10 years, 2 college degrees, and 1000 phone calls later, he finally asked me out at Tibbets Park. Long story short, we are now getting married, and I can‚Äôt wait to spend the rest of my life with my best friend ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
