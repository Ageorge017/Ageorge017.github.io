                        <h3 class="gla_subtitle">His Story</h3>

                        <p align="justify">There wasn‚Äôt one exact moment when I could say I knew Nina was the girl I was going to marry. There were actually a thousand little moments that led up to me knowing that she was the perfect one for me. Throughout our dating years, Nina showed me her loving, compassionate and adorably sweet side that I couldn't (and still can't) resist. Even when she‚Äôs mad and we get into fights, I end up laughing because she even looks adorable when she yells. Nina won my heart in a million little unique ways simply by being the person she is. From making me birthday cakes and surprising me at midnight, to bonding with my family like they were her own, forcing me to take a second and look at sunrises and sunsets to appreciate the little things in life, and making me love dancing with her all made me realize she was the one that I was always meant to be with. </p>
                        <p align="justify">On March 29th, 2019, I proposed to my best friend at Gantry Park overlooking the Manhattan skyline, with the help of one of my best men Blesson. She came blindfolded, in a beautiful blue dress by her cousins Jenny and Ruby. Her family and friends stood by her side as she walked down a lantern lit runway.. We all know how sensitive Nina is, so as expected she pretty much cried the whole runway. When she got to me, I pulled Nina onto a heart made of rose petals.</p>
                            
                        <p align="justify">I had worked really hard to make sure everything went perfect that day so naturally I was nervous, but when Nina finally came down the runway and I took her hand I felt instantly calm. I won't go into the words I said that day but you can imagine I poured my heart out. Then I got on one knee and asked, ‚ÄúWill you marry me?‚Äù Obviously she said Yes üòä</p>
                        <p align="justify">The rest of the night was a blur üòâ</p>

                </div>
   
            </div>

            <div class="container text-right">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12" style="float: right;">
                        <h3 class="gla_subtitle">Her Story</h3>

                        <p align="justify">During the weeks before our proposal, I noticed Anish was becoming more distant everyday. He would make excuses saying he had to stay late at work, but I knew something was up. I had just started a new job, so I was busy myself but was starting to get worried because I didn't know what was wrong. </p>
                        <p align="justify">The week of our proposal my cousin from Florida Ruby Chachey was coming up to visit. She mentioned to my cousin Jenny and I that there was this party she was invited to and didn't really know anyone so she invited us to come along. I thought nothing of it honestly. When the day came closer I asked Anish what I should wear and he suggested that I wear a nice dress. I thought this was weird because it was just a house party LOL . But I mentioned it to my cousins and they thought it was a great idea and that they would wear dresses too. </p>
                            
                        <p align="justify">The day finally came and my cousins met me at my house. We decided to  take an uber to long island where the party was supposed to be. In the car we chatted as per usual and everything seemed pretty normal .. until we kept passing all the long island exits and I started to question where we were going. I kept asking why we were passing all the L.I exits but my cousins would quickly change the topic every time! </p>
                        <p align="justify">Finally, our Uber brought us to the city and parked near some docs. I was really confused at this point because there was nothing else around us but empty road and the East river.</p>
                        <p align="justify">What happened next felt like a kidnapping LOL.</p>
                        <p align="justify">Jenny turned to me and said ‚Äú Ok nina here we go!‚Äù and quickly took a blindfold out of her bag LOL. I had no idea what was going on and started to freak out!  I kept telling her to take the blindfold off, and tell me what was going on. We pretty much all started busting out laughing at this point.. I really didnt know what to expect! </p>
                        <p align="justify">Ruby Chachey and Jenny took my hands and we started to walk. Part of me was freaking out and the other half had so many questions.. Where are we? What am I going to be walking into ? and WHEN COULD I TAKE THE DANG BLINDFOLD OFF?! LOL. Honestly, the walk over felt like it was an hour long. I'm sure it was like a 2 minute walk but you know when you're blindfolded and don't know what's going on every minute feels like forever! Eventually we reached our destination, they took off my blindfold, jacket and turned me around.</p>
                        <p align="justify">I didn't know what to look at  first .. I looked straight ahead and saw the most romantic thing i‚Äôve ever seen in my life. There was a long white runway with red rose petals placed along its side, lanterns on both ends , and finally at the end a GIANT red rose petal heart on white cloth surrounded by yellow stem roses in vases (btw anish will forever get brownie points for this for including my favorite, yellow roses). I turned to my right and saw all my family and friends smiling at me and waving.. (If you hadn't assumed it by this point just know that I was tearing up the entire time lol).  After I took a second to process everything I started walking towards Anish.. when I finally reached him with teary eyes,  The first thing I thought was.. I cannot believe he did all of this for me! And.. I cant believe he kept this a secret! ( Anish usually can never keep any secrets from me , and I‚Äôm the exact same way lol). He had the song ‚ÄúI cant help falling in love with you‚Äù by Haley Reinhart playing in the background and it made the mood so perfect. After telling me all the things he felt in his heart, he finally got down on one knee and proposed.  I said yes , and now here we are üòä</p>
