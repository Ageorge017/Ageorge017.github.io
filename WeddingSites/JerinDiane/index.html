                        <p> <span class = "glow">I met Jerin back in 8th grade at church (he swears that it was 9th but, it wasn’t). It wasn’t until 11th grade when Jerin and I went from acquaintances to close friends (thanks to Jerin’s 200 texts a month). Jerin and I have a lot of mutual friends so we always saw each other at random events. The summer after senior year Jerin mustered up the courage to tell me about his feelings, and I unfortunately did not feel the same way. Jerin remained one of my best friends but over time we drifted a little. Senior year of college rolled around and we both happened to attend a church conference. On one of those days, Jerin came up to me, after barely talking for months, and started hanging out with me to make sure I was having just as much fun. He spent the rest of the conference introducing me to all the people he met and made me laugh just like he used to. The few months after the conference our friendship grew. It took me a long time to admit it to myself but, I had started having feelings for Jerin. After years of not reciprocating, somehow I couldn’t imagine not talking to Jerin every day. I am forever thankful and truly blessed that Jerin never gave up on us. I asked him a few months ago what he thinks would’ve happened if he moved on during the time we weren’t talking, and he responded by saying “it was always you, I never stopped liking you, I just had to wait.”

                           <p><span class = "glow">Contrary to popular belief Diane and I actually met in 9th grade Sunday school. <br>
                            Our story isn’t perfect, but whose is? Diane and I only started becoming friends in my junior year of High school, I had just gotten my junior license and she must have been pretty impressed by that.  By senior year she had become one of my closest friends.  Naturally, I asked her to go to prom with me, I remember being so nervous and sweaty before asking her.  Thank God I asked her over the phone (this was before promposals were a thing), I have never gone out on a limb like that before and I wasn’t sure if she would even want to go with me.  I knew I liked Diane at this point, but I was too scared to tell her in case she didn’t feel the same way and change her mind on going to prom.  I decided to tell her how I felt a couple months later, but she just wanted to be friends, it wasn’t our time.  Looking back on it I’m thankful for that, it gave both of us time to grow and learn about ourselves.  Four years go by and we are both in this conference in Atlanta. I started talking to Diane during one of the walks and I decided to hang out with her more and introduce her to the people I met.  We started talking and became close friends again over time.  Today, she’s my best friend and I can’t wait to marry her.

                        <p> <b>*MAID OF HONOR*</b>  <br>People who know us, know that Divya and I are very different but that makes our relationship even more special. I have always looked up to my older sister; she taught me how to be bold, confident and how to get away with things from our parents. When it comes to her loved ones, she will fight anyone who tries to hurt them. She was my first friend and my biggest critic but she’s the only person I know who will always tell me like it is and I know she would go to the ends of the earth for me. We rarely show emotion to each other, but Divya has taught me to unapologetically be myself and I am excited to have her by my side on my wedding day as my Maid of Honor.</p>

                        <p><b>*MAID OF HONOR*</b>  <br>Stacy has always been more than a cousin to me, she is my little sister and one of my best friends. From getting in trouble with the law in SC, to being roommates in Baltimore, she has been there through it all. Stacy is always there to offer advice and roll her eyes at my corny-ness. Stacy is loyal, driven and would do anything for the ones she loves. She is one of the hardest workers I know, with grad school, teaching dance classes and working, but somehow always makes time to listen to my rants and make sure I’m looking my best with her fashion tips. I can’t imagine getting married without my BCF by my side, I am so lucky to have Stacy as my Maid of Honor. </p>

                        <p>Meeru is my baby cousin, but don’t let that height fool you, she is one of the feistiest people I know. Meeru knows how to light up a room and keep everyone laughing until they can’t breathe. She is the one who keeps me up to date with all things trending and never fails to tell me I am old. She has the biggest heart you’ll ever see and the best dance moves out there. She is the epitome of loyal and always has my back (unless it’s against Stacy). I can’t wait to have her by my side on my special day and see her kill it on the dance floor.</p>

                        <h4>Linda George</h4>
                        <p>Linda is one of my college roommates who I also went to high school with. Linda is the most chill person you will ever meet; she has the kindest heart and sees the good in everything. She knows how to keep seeing the positive in situations and makes sure everyone around her does too.  Linda is always down for anything and knows how to keep calm in stressful situations. Linda is also the person that got me (and Jerin) into the bachelorette which I should kill her for. Linda is passionate about everything she does and has a creative mind. I am grateful to have Linda’s calming presence by my side on our wedding day.</p>

                        <h4>Christine Poulose</h4>
                        <p>I met Christine in high school but it was freshmen year of college where she became my best friend. Christine is sarcastic, funny and loving; she mostly loves to roll her eyes at me, but she also loves to be weird with me. Even though she moved away after college, our friendship has remained the same. I can tell her anything without judgement (maybe a little judgement) and she’s always sincere and supportive even when I annoy her on purpose. I still remember telling Christine first about my feelings for Jerin, and she yelled at me to run to him immediately, which I did not do. Christine is such a big part of my life, and I can’t imagine this day without her.

                        <h4>Jency Skaria</h4>
                        <p>  Jency and I go all the way back to elementary school but high school is where we got close. Jency is the most creative person you will meet. She is resourceful, level headed in emergency situations, and knows how to keep the party going. Jency is the definition of ride or die; she’s always willing to go the extra mile for her friends and family. She makes sure our group of roommates make time to see each other and is the “mom” of the group even though she’s the youngest. You will probably see Jency on our wedding day fixing my hair or stitching the hole Linda tore on her bridesmaid’s outfit, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

                        <p>If you’ve ever met Neena, you know she is a bubbly, fun-loving girl filled with energy and love for all those around her. I met Neena years ago through Cyril, and I am happy to have her as my future sister-in-law. Neena is the sister I never knew I needed, she has been my partner in crime when it comes to the Johns and has helped me in so many ways with all her advice. I love bothering her while she’s working and I know I can always count on her. I am so lucky to have her stand by me on our special day.</p>

                        <h4>Merlyn Abraham </h4>
                        <p>Merlyn is one of those people you can never forget; she brightens up a room and somehow always  remains positive even when things go sour.  I haven’t known her long, but she has already had an impact on my life. She has such a passion for helping others and is always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needs some support. She gives great advice and is always there when you need a shoulder to vent on. I am blessed to have Merlyn by my side and can’t wait to see the energy she brings to our bridal party.

Linda is the most chill person you will ever meet; she has the kindest heart and sees the good in everything. She knows how to keep seeing the positive in situations and makes sure everyone around her does too.  Linda is always down for anything and knows how to keep calm in stressful situations. Linda is also the person that got me (and Jerin) into the bachelorette which I should kill her for. Linda is passionate about everything she does and has a creative mind. I am grateful to have Linda’s calming presence by my side on our wedding day.</span></p>

Christine is sarcastic, funny and loving; she mostly loves to roll her eyes at me, but she also loves to be weird with me. Even though she moved away after college, our friendship has remained the same. I can tell her anything without judgement (maybe a little judgement) and she’s always sincere and supportive even when I annoy her on purpose. I still remember telling Christine first about my feelings for Jerin, and she yelled at me to run to him immediately, which I did not do. Christine is such a big part of my life, and I can’t imagine this day without her.</span>

She makes sure our group of roommates make time to see each other and is the “mom” of the group even though she’s the youngest. You will probably see Jency on our wedding day fixing my hair or stitching the hole Linda tore on her bridesmaid’s outfit, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</span></p>

Like most brothers, we fought a lot, mostly over who got to control the remote to watch TV, or over whose turn it was to play on the Gameboy Color.  Cyril has always been the most well rounded person in our group. He has always been the guy who could be thrown in any circle and be fine socially.  Words cannot express how grateful I am to have you by my side. </p>

                        <p>One of my partners in crime.  Me and Joe have been best friends since preschool.  It was because of Joe that I became more active in school, whether it was joining the school play, Model UN or Intramural Sports.  In many ways it was because of his influence that shaped me to be the person I am today.  If I could use one word to describe him it would be LOYAL, he’s always been there with me through thick and thin and I will forever be grateful for that.   </p>

                        <p>My other partner in crime since I was three.  I remember me Jacob Joe and Cyril trying to convince Manu to play basketball when we were really young (He was into soccer at the time), flash forward a few years and he’s the best one out of the 5 FAMILY FRIENDS.  Manu has always been like that, he’s the one with the hidden talents (Cooking, dancing, elocution etc.) He might have a hard shell, but if you get to know him there’s no one else you would rather have on your side.  </p>

                        <p>Me and Jacob may not technically be related but if anyone asks I’ll always address him as my brother.  We’ve known each other since I was four years old.  He’s the point guard on the basketball court and apparently life too; Jacob has always been the leader of our group.  You convince him to go somewhere and chances are that he’ll convince the rest of us.  You can always count on Jacob to give you that sage advice you may not want to hear but need to hear.  </p>

                        <p>Mikey, where do I begin?  It’s so great to have a younger cousin with so many similar interests.  We went from Sleepovers playing Yu-gi-oh, to watching TV shows like Breaking Bad to eventually NBA and our love of the 76ers.  Mikey is the type of person who is always willing to help out in any way that he can.  </p>

                        <p>“P-Money”, Prasanth is my cousin.  Well it’s a lot easier telling people that then how we really know each other.  Prasanth is someone who is always offering a helping hand, regardless of how big the task may be,  Me and Diane even asked him to Step outside his comfort zone and MC our Engagement Party, you did a great job!

He joined the basketball team; we started the only Fantasy Football league I care about and now this. Andrew is someone who’s down to earth and always down for a good time.

He was the person standing next to me as we passed on our basketball knowledge to the Women’s church basketball team, and watching them win was the highlight of that summer, we couldn’t stop talking about it for months (no joke).  Jaison has always been that constant flow of positivity that I try to exude today.   </p>
